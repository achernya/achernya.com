<h2>Hi!</h2>
<p>
  I'm <a href="//achernya.com/">Alex Chernyakhovsky</a>, a Software
  Engineer at <a href="http://www.google.com/about/">Google</a>. I
  recently graduated from
  the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of
  Technology</a>, where I
  studied <a href="http://www.eecs.mit.edu/">Electrical Engineering
  and Computer Science</a>, more commonly called Course 6.
</p>
<p>
  I enjoy tinkering with distributed systems; from massively parallel,
  distributed simulations to high-availability web services and
  everything in between.  Not only do I look at systems from a
  reliability point-of-view, but I also specialize in systems
  security. I was a member of the team that broke MIT's Kerberos 5
  deployment in 2012 and designed the initial patches that allowed
  OpenAFS to
  <a href="https://www.openafs.org/pages/security/OPENAFS-SA-2013-003.txt">stop
  using DES</a>
  (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4134">CVE-2013-4134</a>)
  while requiring no client-side changes.
</p>
<p>
  Having used Linux since 1998, I'm a firm believer in open source. I
  am currently
  a <a href="https://nm.debian.org/public/person/achernya">Debian
  Maintainer</a>, <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/users/packages/achernya">Fedora
  Packager</a>, and have contributed patches to various open source
  projects such as <a href="http://ipxe.org/">iPXE</a>.
</p>
<p>
  While at MIT, I joined the <a href="http://sipb.mit.edu/">Student
    Information Processing Board (SIPB)</a>. My main responsibilities
    included maintaining the free web-hosting service
  <a href="http://scripts.mit.edu/">Scripts</a>,
  the <a href="http://xvm.mit.edu/">XVM Virtual Machine</a> service,
  and the popular Linux remote-access
  server <a href="http://web.mit.edu/linerva/www/">Linerva</a>.  I was
  also a developer for the dorm management
  system <a href="http://dormbase.mit.edu/">Dormbase</a> and
  contributed to various other SIPB projects.  In January 2014, I
  co-taught the alumni-run
  &ldquo;<a href="http://sipb.mit.edu/iap/6.828/">Caffeinated
  6.828</a>&rdquo; which compressed MIT's semester-long,
  graduate-level operating systems course into 4 short weeks.
</p>
<p>
  I researched the spread of Avian Influenza, developing a novel
  predictive methodology for vaccine strain selection. This research
  has resulted in numerous publications and an invited talk at the
  Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, GA.

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>
  Email to <a href="mailto:alex@achernya.com">alex@achernya.com</a> is
  the easiest way to reach me.  I also maintain a PGP
  key, <a href="http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=0x3224C4469D7DF8F3D6F41A02BBC756DDBE595F6B">
  BBC7 56DD BE59 5F6B</a>, which is available from the key
  servers. Encrypted email may take me a bit longer to respond to, as
  the PGP private key is stored on a limited subset of my
  computers. I'm also
  <a href="https://twitter.com/achernya">@achernya on Twitter</a>
  and <code>achernya</code> on IRC.

<h2>Photography</h2>
<p>
  I enjoy taking photographs, usually landscapes and macro shots. Here
  are some of my latest photos.
